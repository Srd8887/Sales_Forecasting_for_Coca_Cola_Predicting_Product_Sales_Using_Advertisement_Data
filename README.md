# 📈 Coca-Cola Case Study: Predicting Sales from Advertising Spend

> **“Can we predict sales just by knowing how much Coca-Cola spends on ads?”**

In this marketing analytics project, I used **Linear Regression** to build a predictive model that estimates **product sales** based on advertising budgets across **TV, Radio, and Newspaper**. Inspired by Coca-Cola’s global ad strategy, this project simulates real-world media-mix modeling that helps companies **optimize ad spend and boost revenue**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> **Business Case:**  
Coca-Cola spends millions across TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising channels. The goal is to predict future sales based on current media spend.

**Objective:**  
Build a regression model to predict product sales using ad spend as features:
- `TV` 📺 — Ad spend on television
- `Radio` 📻 — Ad spend on radio
- `Newspaper` 📰 — Ad spend on newspaper
- `Sales` 💰 — Actual product sales

## 🧮 Model Building & Evaluation

Built a **Linear Regression Model** using `scikit-learn`, evaluated using:
- R² Score 📈  
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)  
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)  
- Residual & Error Distribution Analysis  

📌 **Best R² Score Achieved:** `X.XXX` *(Plug your value here)*  
📌 Insights revealed that **TV** had the highest influence on sales, followed by **Radio**, while **Newspaper** had minimal impact.
